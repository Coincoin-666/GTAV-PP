                    For the first time in the Grand Theft Auto franchise, we will play one of three characters.<br>
                    Each one of them is defined by a set of characteristics, and one special ability.<br>
                    In this opus, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/">Rockstar Games</a> really took a particular care to the psychology of any of the characters – <em>hence the title of this article</em>.<br>
                    We have been playing those games since GTA II, and although we used to want to clear the game as fast as we could to unlock all weapons, vehicles and islands and cause havoc with an army tank; in this one we really enjoyed starting over, partly because of this.<br>
                    Also, we're playing in an open world from the start so there's no island to unlock.<br>
