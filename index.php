                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>This came to me as a project mainly for two reasons:</p>
                <p>First, I loved those games. From GTA2 in 1999 to this one initially released in 2013. Back then we were SO forbidden to play this sort of games (along with <a href="https://www.stainlessgames.com/games/carmageddon">Carmageddon</a>) so obviously, it was insanely fun.</p>
                <p>Secondly, it was a perfect way for me of doing some politically not-so-correct work – and yes, in the world we live in, that's something very important to me – but hey! Not my fault. It's in the game.</p>
                <p>Enjoy.</p>
